Multiplier2 Circuit
This repository hosts a circom circuit named Multiplier2, designed to facilitate simple multiplication operations utilizing AND, NOT, and OR gates.

Circuit Overview
The Multiplier2 circuit accepts two input signals, denoted as 'a' and 'b', and generates an output signal 'Q'. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

AND Gate: Computes the product of 'a' and 'b'.
NOT Gate: Negates the value of 'b'.
OR Gate: Combines the outputs of the AND gate and the negated 'b' to produce the final output 'Q'.
